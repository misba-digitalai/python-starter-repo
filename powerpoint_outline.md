## Speaker Notes Template

### Slide 2 Notes:
"The key insight here is that n8n's licensing model is based on WHO controls the credentials, not WHAT you build. This is different from traditional per-user or per-feature licensing."

### Slide 7 Notes:
"These examples illustrate the practical difference. If we're using our company's API keys and customers interact with our interface, it's free. If customers connect their own accounts, we need a commercial license."

### Slide 12 Notes:
"I recommend we start with the internal pilot to validate the technology and our use cases, then proceed with commercial discussions once we have a clear picture of our customer-facing requirements."
